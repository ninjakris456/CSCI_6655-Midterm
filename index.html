        <div class="about_description">
            <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who is widely regarded as one of the most influential
                scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for his theory of relativity, which revolutionized
                our understanding of space, time, and gravity. <br>
    
                Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, and grew up in Munich. He studied physics and
                mathematics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and later worked as a
                patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland. <br>
    
                In 1905, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers that laid the foundation for modern physics.
                These papers introduced the theory of special relativity, which explains how time and space are
                relative to the observer's perspective, and the famous equation E=mc², which shows the equivalence
                of mass and energy. <br>
    
                Later, Einstein developed the theory of general relativity, which explains the force of gravity as a
                curvature in spacetime caused by the presence of massive objects. His work also contributed to the
                development of quantum mechanics, which explains the behavior of particles on the atomic and
                subatomic scale. <br>
    
                In addition to his contributions to physics, Einstein was a pacifist and a social activist, speaking
                out against nuclear weapons and working towards world peace. He emigrated to the United States in
                1933 to escape Nazi persecution and became a US citizen in 1940. Einstein died on April 18, 1955, at
                the age of 76.
                <br><br>
                Albert Einstein remains a towering figure in the world of science, and his theories continue to
                inspire new research and breakthroughs to this day.
